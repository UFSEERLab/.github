## Hi there 👋 Welcome to the Spatial Epidemiology & Ecology Research Laboratory 

The SEER Lab is an interdisciplinary Medical Geography research laboratory jointly housed in the Department of Geography and the Emerging Pathogens Institute at the University of Florida. SEER Lab is focused on questions addressing the medical geography, ecology, and spatio-temporal patterns of diseases. You can find more details and information about our research group at our [website](https://seerlab.geog.ufl.edu/).

We will use this space to share code, packages, and works in progress as we develop them. You can follow SEER Lab publications [here](https://seerlab.geog.ufl.edu/publications/). 

**To get started** please check out our [toy-repo](https://github.com/UFSEERLab/toy-repo) for a short tutorial.

🌈 Contribution guidelines - for questions or contributions, please submit an issue to the specific repository.
👩‍💻 Useful resources will be shared here as they become available. In the meantime, check out the GIS tutorials in our [resources page](https://seerlab.geog.ufl.edu/research/gis-skills-tutorials/)
